    <h1>A League Built on Scoring</h1>
    <h2>Examining the Relationship Between Run Differential and Postseason Wins</h2>
    <h3>By Oliver Schaack</h3>
    <p>Major League Baseball's most historic teams are often remembered for their stars and their performance under the brightest lights, esepcially elite hitters. But does team success by run differential directly correlate to postseason success? Or, is there more to it? Below are statistics below showing run differential compared to postseason success of all 30 MLB teams over the past 25 years (1998-2003). As you can see, scoring runs and creating a big lead is important, showcased by the New York Yankees who have the greatest run differential and most postseason wins from '98-'23. However, there is much more that correlates to winning the game of baseball, which is why teams like the Oakland A's for instance have a top 1o run differential, but only 18 postseason wins over 25 years. </p>
